# Balloon Popper

Balloon Popper is a fun and interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
In this project, users can pop balloons by hovering over them, and a message is displayed once all balloons are popped.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Hover over balloons to pop them.
- **Visual Feedback**: Balloons change color and display "POP!" when popped.
- **Completion Message**: Once all balloons are popped, a celebratory message is displayed.

## Usage

1. **Popping Balloons**: Simply hover over the balloons to pop them. Each balloon changes color and shows "POP!" when hovered over.
2. **Completion**: After all balloons are popped, the message "Yay, no more balloons!" will be displayed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start playing the Balloon Popper game.

## Code Explanation

- **Balloon Pop Event**: The event listener detects when a balloon is hovered over and changes its color and text to indicate it has been popped.
- **Removing Event Listeners**: Once a balloon is popped, the event listener is removed to prevent further interaction.
- **Check Completion**: The `checkAllPopped` function checks if all balloons have been popped and displays a message if true.
